        <h2>Wisdom from the Night Sky</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-custom mb-3">
          Published in <a href="https://issuu.com/poeticallypress/docs/issue_six_raison_d_etre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poetically Magazine: Raison D'Être</a>, July 2023
        </p>
        <pre>
Celestially aware they're not alone,
The countless stars pay homage to the sun
As though the brilliance was their very own:
It takes one to know one.

Because our time on earth is deadly short,
Let friendship be the first and last resort.
Though memories are a tangle of distraction,
They soothe us with nostalgic satisfaction.

Genius is expressed in every guise;
When yours appeared it still induced surprise.

Let life and love become the son and daughter,
Who stir the dormant psyche of still water.

Deeply silent is the soul at birth.
But clamorous assaults of joyless mirth
So strike the spirit much to its chagrin,
That finally the frenzied world breaks in.
The metaphor of being deaf and blind
Means likewise "Clear the clutter of your mind."</pre>

        <h2>The Resistant Pyre</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-custom mb-3">
          Published in <a href="https://issuu.com/poeticallymag/docs/poetics_volume_i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POETICS: Volume I</a>, January 2023
        </p>
        <pre>
Thursday night, or to be direct, a time that caused me to reflect
An intimate moment with my sanity hanging from a wire.
Find me placid, partly pleasing, with my hand a stress ball squeezing,
Awake in bed, seldom sneezing, easing back from feeling dire.
"The sickness leaves me," I observed, "teasing back from feeling dire."
Still, within me, burning fire.

As I tried to douse my spirit, wanting bliss or being near it,
Her eyes appeared, as if to fear it, fear my leaving from her mire.
My malady was of the heart - I should have known that, were I smart,
Yet now each thought makes up a part - part of a resistant pyre.
The guilt I feel deftly prevents me from tearing down this pyre,
Battling me like counter-fire.

And her spurious scent unsettles my senses like metals
Rubbing my skin - numbing my logic with how she takes me higher.
"No more of that," I whisper, "at last, become her resistor.
A new future captivates bringing me back from feeling dire.
The bright future captivates bringing me back from feeling dire."
She's not it - there's no more fire.</pre>

      <blockquote class="indentedverse">
        <h2>Stolen Moment</h2>
        <pre>
I'll never shake the way she looked at you:
Leaning close, she brushed your brow, then stepped
Across the table, half in light, half kept
In the shadow. A fleeting smile broke through
The hush, and in that flash I swore there of
Its warmth each time I spoke the words "to love.

That single gesture let me read between
Her silent lines: she'd practiced this refrain
Like some old song, its meaning free of pain,
No past tense written deeply in her green
Eyes. One kiss spoke more than any plea,
And in its depth she gave herself to thee.</pre>

      <blockquote class="indentedverse">
        <h2>Time's Promise</h2>
        <pre>
What better use for words than to inspire;
It is not by chance desire rhymes with fire.
Quickly think to the lessons of the past
And note that the struggle surely won't last.
Then, waking with the odds and ends
Of dreams, we can justly say
"Let us fall into our future
In the same quite astonished way."
For time, who holds us caught
In her arms, has one secret to tell:
Though uncertain today,
The future will surely love us as well.</pre>

      <blockquote class="indentedverse">
        <h2>Gods and Vanity</h2>
        <pre>
The hours we spoke, oblivious to time,
were ticking away the evening in rhyme;
At subtle pace, you wrought my spirit free
To counter you in poetry.

Ambrosia tastes of figs and wine apart;
Who gave you power it employs
to vainly rob me of my poise,
And, through grace, let you earn my art?</pre>

        <h2>Willing Hostage</h2>
        <pre>
Permit me an outlandish truth to share:
In the heart affairs, we're all magicians
Masters of shining a lantern for visions
That often cover the truth with its glare.

Under the surface, just below the waves,
Our spirit, reflected, shows what it craves.
How oft our illusions end as our plight
When we had so readily cast that first light.</pre>

      <!-- Poem 7 -->
      <blockquote class="indentedverse">
        <h2>Nonfiction</h2>
        <pre>
They say that all futures come to a crawl.
That origins set are once and for all.
But where are they now, the former faces,
when surely that time comes and erases?

No singular image stays just the same;
The page has been turned with no one to blame.
Trust and care are just the tips of our range,
But life's one permanence seems to be change.</pre>
